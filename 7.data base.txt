======================
Database:

A database is an abstraction over an operating system's file system that makes it easier
for developers to build applications that create, read, update and delete persistent data.

PostgreSQL and MySQL are two of the most common open source databases for storing Python web applications' data.

SQLite is a database that is stored in a single file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for 
access by a single connection at a time. Therefore is highly recommended to not run a production web application with SQLite.
